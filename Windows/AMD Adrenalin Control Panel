and execute the driver install as usual until you get the "Oops! Something went wrong" message saying no AMD graphics hardware was detected.
Now go to where you unpacked the drivers (C:\AMD by default) and browse to (for the current release) 

C:\AMD\Non-WHQL-Radeon-Software-Adrenalin-2020-22.2.3-Win10-Win11-64Bit-Feb24\Packages\Drivers\Display\WT6A_INF\B376966. 

In there you'll see ccc2_install.exe, that's the settings app installer. Copy ccc2_install.exe to your Deck and run it there. 
After installing it you'll probably also have to install the C++ 2019 x64 redistributable manually, 
it should be in C:\AMD\WU-CCC2\ccc2_install\VC17RTx64 on your Deck after ccc2_install unpacks.

This method has the benefit of showing AMD Settings and its version in the Control Panel Programs and Features app, 
and it can be uninstalled from there if needed.
